# smartphone_sales-dashboard
First project on GitHub.
I created a practice project "Smartphone Sales Dashboard" in MS Excel using publicly available data. The interactive dashboard features slicers of different Smartphone Brands that dynamically update the KPIs and visualizations, the Top 5 brands based on No. of units sold and Average rating, and the average rating between the Smartphones of Apple and Samsung. Undoubtedly a fun experience at using MS Excel to create a full dashboard.
